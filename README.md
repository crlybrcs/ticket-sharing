# ticket-sharing

Responsive full-stack web application aimed to help BVG subscribers to benefit from their transferable tickets while they are away from Berlin. 
The app is built with Node.JS, Express.JS, Passport.JS, Axios, Bootstrap, MongoDB. 

This web application is the second project that we built during the Ironhack(Berlin) circulum.
